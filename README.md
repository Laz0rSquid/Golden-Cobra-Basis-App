Golden Cobra Basis App is created with React Native for iOS and Android.

## Golden Cobra

[Golden Cobra](https://github.com/ikuseiGmbH/Goldencobra) is a CMS based on modules as Rails 4 engines.
First of all, it provides functionalities for creating and rendering contents for websites.

The integrated API also makes it possible to supply other devices. With the Golden Cobra Basis App,
contents from a Golden Cobra instance will be made mobile in a native iOS or Android application.

The Golden Cobra system allows to decide which content is offered for which platform.

With this functionality, apps could be created for all Golden Cobra based websites.

### Additional features

Using the app, it is also possible to access the camera, receive notifications or access the geolocation.
This represents an added value compared to the implementation only as a website.
